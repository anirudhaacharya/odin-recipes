    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add lentils and water to a blender, or food processor and soak for at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Blend lentils until they are very smooth. Season with salt. (Batter can be used immediately, but for best results refrigerate overnight).</li>
        <li>To cook, heat a non-stick pan on medium-high. Grease lightly with olive oil and allow to get hot. Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter to the hot pan. Use the bottom of a ladle or spoon to spread out into a 5 or 6 inch circle. Lower heat to medium, and adjust from there if needed. Cook the first side for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, before flipping over. Cook the second side for about 2 minutes, before transferring to a plate.</li>
        <li>Keep warm flatbreads covered with a towel while cooking and stacking.</li>
    </ol>
